Angelou originally repeats the phrase, \"I rise\" three times in the written work, but the speaker says \"there I go rising,\" demonstrating their ability to continue to move forward and not look back. The change with this line also removes the emphasis in the words \"I rise,\" which might impact the powerful effect the speaker is attempting to convey with the assertion that they can rise above hardships no matter what. The new phrase allows the poem to leave off with suspense, as it places the speaker in a position of continuity and implies that their ability to rise is continuous and will not be stopped"
